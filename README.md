# Stream Generator File Manager

![2024-07-28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53867487-deb0-4bb6-8c1f-5d8b14c8a690)

This mod enables saving and loading streams you make yourself in the game's official Stream Generator Update (released on July 15 2024)... at least until the dev's release their own official file manager.

Files saved using this mod are also compatible with the [Custom Stream Maker](https://github.com/amazeedaizee/CustomStreamMaker) program and vice versa. When saving stream files between the two, please note:
- Only stream backgrounds found in the game, and any dialogue involving KAngel will be shown in the stream generator.
- Custom assets and backgrounds are currently not supported at this time.
- When loading files made from the Custom Stream Maker, some information meant for said program will be kept in the file, however other stream events and chat comments will be lost during saving.

Some extra features that also exist in this mod include: automatically setting a start animation before you play your stream. Would be pretty awkward if KAngel suddenly pops into her guru outfit or turns into Ame now wouldn't it?

### Note: You must have BepInEx pre-configured and enabled with the game to use this mod.
